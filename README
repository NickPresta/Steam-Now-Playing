This is a simple Python wrapper to fetch game and player details
from a Steam Community page.

Pass in a Steam Community page ID (either numeric, or the custom URL)
and it will spit out data that it knows about.

See: http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API
for a listing of the public/private fields that are exposed.

This correctly uses profiles which have custom URLs and ones which do
not (default 17 digit ID).
