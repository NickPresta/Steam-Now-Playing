A Google App Engine project that fetches your Steam user information:

  * Your display name
  * Your current activity (currently playing, offline stats, etc)
  * Details about the game you're playing (Server, Icon, etc)

This project allows you to login via your Google account and then
allows you to securely login through the Steam Community site to fetch
your data. No need to find your profile ID, or anything else.
